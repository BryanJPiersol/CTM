Civilian Topographic Map (CTM)

AT 10.3 Production Mapping contains a new Civilian Topographic Map (CTM) product that illustrates the full capabilities of Production Mapping. CTM includes a geodatabase data model as well as sample Production Mapping configuration files for editing, quality control, cartography, and generalization. 

The schema of CTM is based on the National System for Geospatial Intelligence Feature Data dictionary (NFDD).   The NFDD is a comprehensive dictionary and coding scheme for feature types, feature attributes, and attribute values. The NFDD conforms to a subset of ISO 19126, Geographic information - Feature concept dictionaries and registers, and its information schema.  Esri has chosen a subset of NFDD feature types and attributes for CTM that are appropriate for those creating topographic maps in a civilian context.  

For more information about the NFDD specification visit - https://nsgreg.nga.mil/fdd/registers.jsp?register=NFDD.  On this page, you will see links that allow you to browse or search the NFDD specification for a complete list of feature and attribute types.
